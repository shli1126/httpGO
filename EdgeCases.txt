1. 
If this timeout occurs and the client has sent part of a request, 
but not a full request, then the server should reply back with a 
400 client error (described below) ?????

2. 
 A well-formed URL always starts with a / character. If the slash 
 is missing, send back a 400 error. Note that if the URL ends 
 with / like /path/to/dir/, then you should interpret that as if 
 the client requested the URL /path/to/dir/index.html.  !!!!!

3.
Note that if the URL ends with / like /path/to/dir/, then you 
should interpret that as if the client requested the
URL /path/to/dir/index.html.

4.
Any request that doesn't align with the specifications outlined 
in this document should be responded to with a 400 status code.

5.
<key> is composed of one or more alphanumeric or the hyphen "-" character 
(i.e. <key> cannot be empty). It is case-insensitive. <value> can be any 
string not starting with space, and not containing CRLF. It is case-sensitive. 
As a special case <value> can be an empty string.

6.
Host (required, 400 client error if not present)


7.
Any request headers not in the proper form (e.g., missing a colon), should signal a 400 error.


8.
For the ease of testing, please write response headers in sorted order / alphabetical order. 
(Note for real HTTP, there is no need to write headers in any particular order)


9.
Our response messages might have a body if it’s a 200 response. In this case, the message body 
is basically the bytes of the requested file to serve to the client. 400 and 404 messages don’t have a body.
